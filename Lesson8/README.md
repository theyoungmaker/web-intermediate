# Lesson 8 Summary â€” Conditionals in React

- Use ternaries for switching between two UI branches: `condition ? A : B`.
- Use short-circuit `&&` to render something only when a condition is truthy.
- Prefer early returns or helper functions to keep JSX simple and avoid deep nesting.
- Combine state + conditionals to drive dynamic UI (e.g., weather, auth status, temperature categories).

Exercises:
- Exercise 1: Weather checker with ternary and `&&`.
- Exercise 2: Auth status headline with conditional section.
- Exercise 3: Temperature categories and notices with nested ternaries.

Refer to the `solutions/` folder for example implementations.
