## TYM Web Dev Intermediate

### Overview
This repository contains two main parts:
- **Lesson folders** with exercises, ongoing component work, and example solutions.
- **A browser-based quiz app**: `index.html`, `lesson1.html` … `lesson14.html`.

See the full directory tree in `DIRECTORY.md`.

### Lesson Folders (Lesson2 … Lesson14)
Each `LessonX/` directory includes practice materials for that lesson:
- **`component.jsx`**: the running weekly updates learners make to a component as they iterate toward their final project implementation.
- **`exercise*.jsx`**: hands-on tasks for the lesson.
- **`solutions/`**: example solutions. Since this is front-end UI, “solutions” are illustrative reference implementations (not the only correct answer).

Some lessons also include a lesson-specific `README.md` with extra notes.

### Lesson Quiz App
- **`index.html`**: Dashboard to access lesson quizzes.
- **`lesson1.html` … `lesson14.html`**: Individual quiz pages. Each quiz contains 10 multiple-choice questions with Grade, Reset, and Show Answers controls.

How to use:
1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (no build step required).
2. Click into any lesson to take the quiz.

### Quiz App
- **Weekly Lesson Quizzes**: Checks your knowledge on the topics.
- Live site: [tym-web-dev-intermediate.vercel.app](https://tym-web-dev-intermediate.vercel.app/)

### Online Compiler
To avoid spending time setting up a new React app for every exercise:
- Use the React online compiler: [nextleap.app/online-compiler/reactjs-programming](https://nextleap.app/online-compiler/reactjs-programming)
- All exercises exist as one single component so you don’t have to keep setting up environments.

### Local Development Tips
- You can use a lightweight static server (e.g., VS Code Live Server) for convenient testing, or simply open the HTML files directly in your browser.
